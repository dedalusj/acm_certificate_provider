# ACM Certificate Provider

This SAM template will create a Lambda function that be used to automate the creation of ACM certificates within a CloudFormation template.

Not much original here, simply repackaged from [cfn-certificate-provider](https://github.com/binxio/cfn-certificate-provider) into a SAM template exporting the function name.

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html) to package and deploy the application.
